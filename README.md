Creating GitHub documentation for your project involves several steps. Here's a basic outline of what you can include:

1. **README.md**: This is the main documentation file that provides an overview of your project. Include information such as:
   - Project name and description
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Contribution guidelines
   - License information
   - Contact details or support links
   
2. **Documentation Folder**: Create a folder named "docs" or "documentation" to store additional documentation files, such as:
   - User manuals
   - API documentation
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Release notes
   
3. **Wiki Pages**: Use GitHub's built-in wiki feature to create additional documentation pages. You can use wiki pages to provide more detailed information about specific aspects of your project, such as:
   - Installation guides for different platforms
   - Configuration options
   - Troubleshooting tips
   
4. **Code Comments**: Ensure that your code is well-commented to explain its functionality, usage, and any important considerations. This can serve as a form of documentation for developers who need to understand or modify the code in the future.

5. **External Links**: Include links to external resources or related documentation that may be useful for users or contributors.

Here's an example of how you can structure your README.md file:

```markdown
